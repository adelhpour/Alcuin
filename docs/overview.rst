Description
###########

NetworkEditorGUI is an open-source portable graphical user interface library that provides developers with an embeddable Qt widget that has the fundamental features required for network viewer and editor software tools. Using NetworkEditorGUI, a developer can straightforwardly add network viewer and editor features into their tool and customize it at their will through its plugin interface. This plugin interface allows the developer to write code in Python and customize their app features to meet their specific requirements.

Goals
#####

The basic idea behind developing NetworkEditorGUI is creating a GUI library that can be used by developers to add a network viewer and editor tool in their projects with very little effort. By doing so, a developer will provide their users with an easy-to-use user interface giving them the option of constructing networks from scratch or loading and editing existing networks. Through its plugin interface, NetworkEditorGUI provides the developers with the option of customizing its features at their will so that it can fit all their users' purposes.
