NetworkEditorGUI is an open-source portable GUI library that provides developers with an embeddable Qt widget with the fundamental features required for network viewer and editor software tools. Using NetworkEditorGUI, a developer can straightforwardly add network viewer and editor features into their tool and customize it at their will through its plugin interface. This plugin interface allows the developer to write code in Python and customize their app features to meet their specific requirements.

NetworkEditorGUI is being developed and maintained by Adel Heydarabadipour and Herbert Sauro at `Sys-Bio Lab <https://www.sys-bio.org>`_
